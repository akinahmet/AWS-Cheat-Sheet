### Use Cloudformation to create an EC2 instance
- Go to AWS console page
- Create a template on your local machine. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTemplate.html) for more details of template creating.
- At AWS Consol Click on **services** and search for Cloudformation.
- You are at Cloudformation main dashboard 
- Click on **Create Stack**
- Select "Template is ready" (assuming we created a template above)
- Select "Upload a template file" and upload your template
(If you have already a template in AWS S3 you can choose Amazon S3 URL)
- Click on **Next** and enter a Stack name
- Choose the instance type, and existing key from your account.
- Click on **Next**
- Tags are optional, you may or may not add tags in this step
- Now you don't need to set 'Configure stack options'
- Review and click **Create Stack** 


## AWS Server

### Connect to your instance from your VS Code
(We have already created an instance)
- Go to AWS console page
- Click on **EC2**
- Click on **Instances**
- Select previously created instance
- Click on **Connect**
- Find 'Connect to your instance using its Public DNS'
- Copy this link
- Go to your VS Code
- Open a Terminal in the directory
- Open terminal in the directory where the your key is
- Paste the link
- Write 'yes'
- And we connected from our computer to our EC2ðŸ’ª

## AWS EC2 Volumes

###  Extend Root Volume
(We have already created an Amazon Linux 2 instance with default ebs volume and ssh)
- Go to AWS console page
- Click on **EC2**
- Click on **Instances**
- Connect your Instance
- List block devices (lsblk)

```bash
   lsblk
```
- Verify the file system in use for each volume

```bash
   df -h
```

- Check file system of the root volume's partition.

```bash
   sudo file -s /dev/xvda1
```

- Go to Volumes, select instance's root volume and modify it (increase capacity 8 GB >> 12 GB)

```bash
   sudo file -s /dev/xvda1
```

-  Extend partition 1 on the modified volume and occupy all newly avaiable space.

```bash
   sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
```

- Resize the xfs file system on the extended partition to cover all available space.

```bash
   sudo xfs_growfs /dev/xvda1
```

- List block devices (lsblk) and file system disk space usage (df) of the instance again. Partition and file system should be extended.

```bash
   lsblk
```
```bash
   df -h
```

## Install Nginx Web Server on EC2 Linux 2

(We have already created an Amazon Linux 2 instance)
- Connect to your instance with SSH.
```bash
   ssh -i [Your Key pair] ec2-user@[Your EC2 IP / DNS name]
```

- Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.
```bash
   sudo yum update -y
```

- Install the Nginx Web Server.
```bash
   sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1
```

- Install the Nginx Web Server.
```bash
   sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1
```

- Start the Nginx Web Server.
```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
```

- Check from browser with public IP/DNS
