# Amazon Web Services Cheat Sheet for beginners

## AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

### Create security group
(We will use secutity group in the next steps.)

- Open the Amazon **EC2** console.
- Choose `Security Groups` on the left-hand menu,
- Click the `Create Security Group` tab.
- You will see this:

```text
Security Group Name  : Please write a name

or
- (With nginx) Open the file `user_data_for_nginx.txt` in this repository and copy content,
- Paste it in user data,
- Click on **Launch Instance**

### Connect to your instance (method1)
(We have already created an instance)
- Go to AWS console page
- Click on **EC2**
- Click on **Instances**
- Select previously created instance

- And we connected from our computer to our EC2ðŸ’ª

### Connect to your instance (method2)

(We have already created an instance)
- Go to AWS console page and copy your puplic IP,
- Open your VS Code,
- Click on **Open a remote window** (bottom left),
- Click on **Open ssh configuration file**
- Edit config file

   `TCPKeepAlive` yes

   `ServerAliveInterval` 60

   `Host` You can write your name

   `HostName` Your puplic IP

   `IdentityFile` Your pem file path

   `User` ec2-user  for Amazon linux 

- Save and close
- Again Click on **Open a remote window**
- Click on **connect to host**
- And continue ...

### Use Cloudformation to create an EC2 instance
- Go to AWS console page
- Create a template on your local machine. Click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTemplate.html) for more details of template creating.

- Select "Upload a template file" and upload your template
(If you have already a template in AWS S3 you can choose Amazon S3 URL)
- Click on **Next** and enter a Stack name
- Choose the instance type, and existing key from your account.
- Click on **Next**
- Tags are optional, you may or may not add tags in this step

```text
Ports for the selected instances : 80
```
- Click `Include as pending below` button.
- Show that two instances are added to the target group.

###  EC2 Extend Root Volume
(We have already created an Amazon Linux 2 instance with default ebs volume and ssh)
- Go to AWS console page
- Click on **EC2**
- Click on **Instances**
- Connect your Instance
- List block devices (lsblk)

```bash
   lsblk
```
- Verify the file system in use for each volume

```bash
   df -h
```

- Check file system of the root volume's partition.

```bash
   sudo file -s /dev/xvda1
```

- Go to Volumes, select instance's root volume and modify it (increase capacity 8 GB >> 12 GB)

```bash
   sudo file -s /dev/xvda1
```

-  Extend partition 1 on the modified volume and occupy all newly avaiable space.

```bash
   sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
```

- Resize the xfs file system on the extended partition to cover all available space.

```bash
   sudo xfs_growfs /dev/xvda1
```

- List block devices (lsblk) and file system disk space usage (df) of the instance again. Partition and file system should be extended.

```bash
   lsblk
```
```bash
   df -h
```
